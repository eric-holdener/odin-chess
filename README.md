# odin-chess

This project took me about half a month working on it in tandem with continuing my learning and reading on other topics. Overall, it works, but there are several areas I would like to improve, both in the code and mentally.

Firstly, this project could have benefitted alot from taking my time more at the beginning and pseudocoding out more. It devolved very quickly into just adding features as I realized I needed then. I still tried to TDD these new features, writing out unit tests for how they should work before actually creating the functions, but I would like to drive my code in the future, not the other way around.

As a result of this lack of sufficient planning in the beginning, the code is much larger and sloppier than it should be. I want to revisit this code in the future with a fresh set of eyes and try to refactor it, make it prettier and cleaner overall.

TO DO's in the future
- Add castling functionality to moves (this was an oversight)
- Refactor code
- Add a computer AI to play against the human player

However, despite these reflections on how it could be better, I'm still very proud of creating this game. It's my first relatively large complex project, and I'm very happy I stuck with it and worked through all the kinks. I've spent the last month or so having my mind race at night trying to find new ways to accomplish the creation of this game, so I am very happy to have this obsession completed. Onto the next project!
